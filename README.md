# Boondock Sam
## About

Boondock Sam is a classic 2D platformer game in the spirit of the 1990s
written in C using SDL2 and the
[TMX Map Format](http://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/reference/tmx-map-format/)
(Tile Map XML).

Last but not least: follow-on project of
[Rainbow Joe](https://github.com/mupfelofen-de/rainbow-joe) which I do
not wanna develop any further.

## Why C?

A question I hear alot is why I'm using C for this project instead of a
modern language like Rust, Haskell or `[insert your preferred language
here]`, because writing games in C is neither a easy thing to do nor
very common (these days).

The main reason is simple: to get exercise in C programming.  And
writing a game in C seemed like a fun way of getting some.  Even though
I am currently trying to get on with Haskell, I still consider C a fun
and challenging language.

Anyway: I hope you find the code of this project useful.  If so, feel
free to use it in any way you want. Just consider buying me a beer in
case we meet someday.

## Dependencies

The program has been successfully compiled with the following libraries:
```
libxml2    2.9.8
sdl2       2.0.8
sdl2_image 2.0.3
sdl2_mixer 2.0.2
zlib       1.2.11
```

#### MacOS

All libraries can be installed normally via `brew` given the above formula names.

Additionally, MacOS builds require `icu4c` (installed with `brew install icu4c`).

Further, `icu4c` and `libxml2` will need to be force-linked using
`brew link --force icu4c libxml2`.

## Compiling

To compile _Boondock Sam_ under Linux simply enter:
```
make
```

If you're on NixOS enter:
```
nix-shell --command make
```

Due libxml2 isn't available via
[emscripten-ports](https://github.com/emscripten-ports), the Emscripten
support is in an experimental stage:
```
make emscripten
```

To generate the documentation using doxygen enter:
```
doxygen
```
